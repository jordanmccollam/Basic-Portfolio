    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I'm Jordan McCollam. I recently moved to Nashville with my wife, which is also a new thing! My wife, Leesha and I, got married
        September 16th and moved here from California. Although fun fact, she's actually from the Netherlands!
        But anyways, down to business . . . 
        I started my own business as a music producer and mix engineer. I've been working with music for a few
        years now but recently decided that I wanted to steer my career in a different direction. And that's what brought to Vanderbilt's
        coding bootcamp. Now I hope to build this portfolio and become a great coder to support my new family.

        So of course, my hobbies include playing and working on music. But I also love.. well.. pretty much anything competitive. Board games,
        video games, soccer, whatever! You name it! I'm a big TV binger. I love to get wrapped up in stories. However I am running out of TV shows
        so only recently started reading and, to my surprise, I'm really enjoying that too!
